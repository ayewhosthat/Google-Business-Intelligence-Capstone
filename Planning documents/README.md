## Step 1: Planning
Before anything is done, we must plan the entire thing, else we risk running a disorganized and hectic mess. Planning means communicating early on with key stakeholders, asking them effective questions that allows us to uncover their goals for the project: What do they want to use this BI tool for? Doing so allows us to put ourselves in their shoes and ask ourselves, "If I were in their position, with my goals in mind, what would I want the dashboard to look like? What insights am I looking for?" In particular, there are 3 important documents that should be completed before moving onto the next stage, they are described below.

### Stakeholder requirements
As per Google's Business Intelligence Certificate, "The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables us to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:"
- Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?
- Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles? 
- Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?
- Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful?

Since the stakeholders are typically executives and higher ups, it is important to complete this document first, to make sure that going forward, the rest of the project is completed with the stakeholders' best interests in mind.

### Project requirements
This document outlines key desirables for the project, of which include:
- User journeys: What does user experience look like currently? What is the ideal scenario for user experience?
- Are there any privacy or legal considerations?
- What does success look like? How do we measure it?
- What is the project's roll out plan? (schedule)

### Project strategy
Here, we strategize and start to shape the actual BI tool:
- Access: Who gets access, and what level?
- What datasets are to be used?
- Dashboard Mockups are included
- Charts are brainstormed here (dimensions used, metrics involved, what type of chart to use)

Like with all matters, to set yourself up for success, planning is a non-negotiable. It prepares us and allows us to see the big picture, which lends itself to efficiently powering through each successive stage on our way to producing a top tier BI tool to help stakeholders identify and act on insights.
