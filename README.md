This was a cool way to dip my feet into the world of business intelligence and get a glimpse into what business intelligence professionals do. Coming from a predominantly analytics background, I was curious about the difference between the two fields, and this certificate was a great eye-opening experience to help me understand said difference.

<b>
Business Intelligence Professionals
</b>

- Focus on automation and scaling to make data more accessible and digestible to others
- Build pipelines and dashboards, to name a few
- Don't necessarily perform analysis themselves
<br>
<b>
Data Analysts
</b>

- Mainly tasked with interpreting the data
- Predictive modeling, machine learning, forecasting, conducting statistical analysis
- Will often used resources provided by BI professionals (models, dashboards) to conduct their analysis

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this experience, from completing the planning documents, implementing ETL pipelines, and creating engaging dashboards using Tableau, and am excited to be able to add business intelligence as a skill to my repitoire!
